# MOR-UAV

This repository contains a Keras implementation of the paper 'MOR-UAV: A Unified Deep Framework for 'Moving Object Recognition on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles' accepted in ACM MM 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first attempt for simultaneous localization and classification of moving objects in ariel video, i.e. moving object recognition (MOR) on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in a single-stage deep learning framework.

We used the code base of [fizyr/keras-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) for our work.
We forked off from [fizyr/keras-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet) tag 0.5.1.

## Description

The MOR is one of the essentiale tasks to support various UAV vision-based applications including aerial surveillance, search and rescue, event recognition, urban and rural scene understanding.To the best of our knowledge, no labeled dataset is available for MOR evaluation in UAV videos.
Therefore, in this paper, we introduce MOR-UAV, a large-scale video dataset for MOR in aerial videos. We achieve this by labeling axis-aligned bounding boxes for moving objects which requires less computational resources than producing pixel-level estimates. We annotate 89,783 moving object instances collected from 30 UAV videos, consisting of 10,948 frames in various scenarios such as weather conditions, occlusion, changing flying altitude and multiple camera views. We assigned the labels for two categories of vehicles (car and heavy vehicle).

MOR-UAV is first attempt for MOR in UAV videos, we present 16 baseline results based on the proposed framework over the MOR-UAV dataset through quantitative and qualitative experiments. We also analyze the motion-salient regions in the network through multiple layer visualizations.

## Installation

1) Clone this repository.
2) Ensure numpy is installed using `pip install numpy --user`
3) In the repository, execute `pip install . --user`.
   Note that due to inconsistencies with how `tensorflow` should be installed,
   this package does not define a dependency on `tensorflow` as it will try to install that (which at least on Arch Linux results in an incorrect installation).
   Please make sure `tensorflow` is installed as per your systems requirements.
4) Run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` to compile Cython code first.

## Training

MOR-UAV can be trained using this train.py script.
Note that the train script uses relative imports since it is inside the keras_retinanet package.

Model can be trained on all csv files in `--csv_path CSV_PATH` folder.
Randomly select a video, read continuous frames, compute the optical map between the current frame and frames from temporal with distance 1, 3 and 5, respectively, perform estimation using resnet 50 and retinanet pyramid.
At end of each video, randomly select new video, start with 5th (Max of previous frame needed for optical flow) frame.

### CSV datasets

The CSV file with annotations should contain one annotation per line. Images with multiple bounding boxes should use one row per bounding box. Note that indexing for pixel values starts at 0. The expected format of each line is:

```shell
path/to/image.jpg,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
```

By default the CSV generator will look for images in csv_folder/train/ directory of the annotations (csv) file.

### Class mapping format

The class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line. Each line should use the following format:

```
class_name,id
```

Indexing for classes starts at 0. Do not include a background class as it is implicit.

Model summary can be found in model_summary.md.
**Model of trained MOR-UAV model is attached in snapshots folder.**

## Converting a training model to inference model

The training procedure of MOR-UAV works with training models. These are stripped down versions compared to the inference model and only contains the layers necessary for training (regression and classification values). If you wish to do inference on a model (perform object detection on an image), you need to convert the trained model to an inference model.

### Usage

```shell

keras_retinanet/bin/convert_model.py snapshots/resnet50_csv_60.h5 snapshots/model.h5 

positional arguments:
  model_in              The model to convert.
  model_out             Path to save the converted model to.
optional arguments:

```

## Testing
